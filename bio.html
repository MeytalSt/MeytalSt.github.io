          <h3 id="succulent">URBAN UNICORN</h3>
          <p>Most people ask me how to pronounce my name - may-TAHL. My name means water of dew in Hebrew. I’m a Sabra (that’s what native Israelis are called), which is also a type of cactus. But I’m not a very prickly Sabra. I like to think of myself as more refined, like a succulent.</p>
          <p>In college I studied early childhood education. After college I started working for my family’s humanitarian aid organization, where I was an administrative assistant and department manager.</p>
          <p>Fast forward a few years and I was ready for a change. I went to work for a Christian TV station in Jerusalem as a network planner. After my girls were born, I took a step back from working full time and focused on raising them.</p>
          <p>I went back to working for my family’s organization after moving to Minnesota. Through my role as a global content manager, my eyes were opened to the world of UX/UI design. I was itching to do something creative and further my education, and decided to study UX/UI design.</p>
          <p>As I look back at the process which brought me to this point in my life, it started with a desire to design, to be creative, but I discovered that there’s so much more than that. UX design has a purpose and is backed by research—to make things function better, to improve processes and make things more efficient. That is what I love about it.</p>
          <p>Add to the mix my love for people. I’m a people person. I love to interact with people. By being a UX designer I put people at the center of what I do. I think, “How can I make this easier? How can this make someone’s life better?”</p>
          <p>One of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on so far is <span class="bold-pink">RE:fresh</span>, a health and fitness app that gives people the tools they need to live a healthier lifestyle, something I’m passionate about.</p>

          <h3>WHY URBAN UNICORN?</h3>
          <p>My youngest daughter is really into unicorns right now, so she inspired me to dub myself Urban Unicorn.
            I grew up in a city and to this day I love city life. Now I live in a small town, about an hour from the Twin Cities. I still miss city life but I love raising my children here.
            I try to go to Minneapolis-St. Paul as often as I can, and every now and then I go to New York City and get my dose of urban scenery.</p>

          <h3>DEFINING MOMENTS</h3>
          <p>Just like everyone else, I have experienced a few hardships in my life.</p>
          <p>Moving to a different country and leaving behind my beloved family and friends in my homeland has probably been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It involved adjusting to a different culture and climate, and it also meant becoming part of a minority group. As a person with high self-awareness, I found myself struggling to find my purpose as an adult and my place in this new country. I had a strong urge to do something new and develop who I am. Becoming a UX/UI designer is part of this journey.</p>

          <h3>MY INSPIRATION</h3>
          <p>Living in Minnesota and experiencing the four seasons has been a source of inspiration for me. Nature has the most perfect color combinations that I like to transfer into my designs. I also get my inspiration from the beaches of Israel and the east coast.</p>
          <p>I have a varsetile personality which helps me connect with a wide variety of people. As a UX designer it’s critical because it helps me understand the uniqueness of each person. Ultimately, my goal in life is to make a difference in people’s lives.</p>

          <h3>MY FAVORITE THINGS</h3>
          <p>I am a very active person and when I’m not working you can find me spending time with my family and friends, exercising, getting creative in the kitchen and spending time in nature. I also love pottery and dream of owning my own studio one day.</p>
          <p>In the summer, I enjoy gardening, shopping at the farmers market, going to the lake with my kids and checking out festivals and fairs. Winters are a time for self-development, reading and of course, spending time with my loved ones.</p>
          <p>I enjoy traveling as often as I can. My favorite destinations are New York City, Israel, and Europe and I hope to travel to Australia and the Far East in the future.</p>
