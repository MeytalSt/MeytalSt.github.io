<!-- Problem/Solution section -->
      <section>
        <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>In this project I was asked to research and design a cloud storage app. The issue I was expected to solve was to find a solution for a cloud storage app that would have features that stand out of the other competitors such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Pinterest and Evernote.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>RE:fresh is a cloud storage app that is tailored for health and fitness enthusiasts. Through the research I conducted, I discovered that there is room for a cloud storage app that is specific for health & fitness, where users can store all of their interests as well as get tools that will help them stay on track with their goals.</p>

<!-- Process section -->
      <section class="process">
        <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
        <p>In this project, a client was excited about the possibilities in the cloud storage and organization market. He didn’t have a very clear vision in mind, and I had to come up with an idea. The goal was to find the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience.</p>
        <p>The client had a few features that he wanted included in the app:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saving content from the web</li>
          <li>Organizing the content using some kind of organization system</li>
          <li>Creating content</li>
          <li>Uploading files from a computer or mobile device</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
          <li>Sharing</li>
          <li>Connecting with other users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The client also wanted to leverage the “Network Effect” for growth.</p>
        <p>My role was to do the research and analyze processes in the competitors’ products as well as design the app.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH & DISCOVERY</h2>
        <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
        <p>I researched some popular cloud storage apps: Pinterest, Paprika (recipe manager), Foursquare (travel site) and Fitbit. I was trying to determine which market would benefit from a cloud storage app. I discovered that there are already plenty of products in the organizing, recipes and travel markets. However, I saw that there is room for a health and fitness app in the cloud storage market.</p>
        <p>You can read more about the competitive analysis here. </p>
        <img src="images/table.png" alt="competitive analysis image"/>
        <p>I also analyzed the user flows of each of the competitors for onboarding, saving an item and organizing into categories, so that I could see the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors.</p>
        <p>You can find the user flows <b>here</b>.</p>

<!-- Survey section -->
      <section>
        <h3>SURVEY</h3>
        <p>The goals of the survey were:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To determine if the users are interested in the features that the client wanted.</li>
          <li>Find out if users really want collaboration features and what kind of collaboration features would they like. Also, who would the users collaborate with and how?</li>
          <li>Get users thoughts about the competition: are they using any of the competing products? And, what do users like and dislike about the competitors’ products?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>See survey</p>
