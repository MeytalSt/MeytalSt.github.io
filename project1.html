          <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p class="problem-copy">In this project I was asked to research and design a cloud storage app. The issue I was expected to solve was to find a solution for a cloud storage app that would have features that stand out of the other competitors such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Pinterest and Evernote.</p>

          <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
          <p class="solution-copy">RE:fresh is a cloud storage app that is tailored for health and fitness enthusiasts. Through the research I conducted, I discovered that there is room for a cloud storage app that is specific for health & fitness, where users can store all of their interests as well as get tools that will help them stay on track with their goals.</p>

<!-- Process section -->
      <section class="process" id="process">
        <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
        <p>In this project, a client was excited about the possibilities in the cloud storage and organization market. He didn’t have a very clear vision in mind, and I had to come up with an idea. The goal was to find the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience.</p>
          <p>The client had a few features that he wanted included in the app:</p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li class="feat">Saving content from the web</li>
          <li class="feat">Organizing the content using some kind of organization system</li>
          <li class="feat">Creating content</li>
          <li class="feat">Uploading files from a computer or mobile device</li>
          <li class="feat">Collaboration</li>
          <li class="feat">Sharing</li>
          <li class="feat">Connecting with other users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The client also wanted to leverage the “Network Effect” for growth.</p>
        <p>My role was to do the research and analyze processes in the competitors’ products as well as design the app.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH & DISCOVERY</h2>
        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
        <p>I researched some popular cloud storage apps: Pinterest, Paprika (recipe manager), Foursquare (travel site) and Fitbit. I was trying to determine which market would benefit from a cloud storage app. I discovered that there are already plenty of products in the organizing, recipes and travel markets. However, I saw that there is room for a health and fitness app in the cloud storage market.</p>

          <h4>SITE MAP & CONTENT STRATEGY</h4>
            <p>I created a site map based on the user stories and user flows and made sure that each was represented in the site map.</p>

          <h4>WIREFRAMES</h4>
            <p>I started sketching the wireframes by hand, using the Crazy Eights technique for the landing page.</p>
            <p>I hand sketched all the wireframes and then went on to design them on Figma. I designed the wireframes for a desktop. As I was designing the wireframes, I referred back to the user stories, user flows, personas and content strategy to make sure that everything is included.</p>

          <h4 id="prototype">CLICKABLE PROTOTYPE I</h4>
            <p>More details in the processes of each user flow came up that I didn’t think about in the wireframing stage. I spent a considerable amount of time creating the prototype, using Figma. I added screens that were essential for the proper function of the website, and referred back to the user flows to make sure every step was represented. I had to alter some of the user flows when I saw that some of the things I included there didn’t make sense. </p>
          <div>
            <h6>Sign-up page</h6>
              <p>There was too much space between elements. I reduced the spacing and  changed the layout of fields and buttons to being side by side.</p>

          <h4>USABILITY TEST</h4>

            <p>5–Logging food or activity</p>
            <p>Through the testing I discovered some issues with the prototype:</p>
            <ul class="issues">
              <li class="issue">Adding a piece of content wasn’t easy for all the users</li>
              <li class="issue">Organizing a piece of content wasn’t very easy for some of the users</li>
              <li class="issue">There was no option of sharing items directly</li>
              <li class="issue">There was no option to share other people’s posts on the newsfeed</li>

        <h2>RE-EVALUATING PROJECT SCALE</h2>
          <p>After testing the prototype, I felt that my project got out of scope. I decided to remove some of the user stories/flows from the project that were not necessary for the MVP. This was very hard to do, because I really wanted to have some of those special features that I haven’t seen in other products, but for the sake of keeping within scope, I understood it was necessary.</p>
          <p class="bold">The tasks that were removed from the project:</p>
            <ul class="tasks">
              <li class="task">Auto synching the fitness tracker</li>
              <li class="task">Scheduling workouts for the week</li>

        <h4>BRANDING</h4>
          <p>Branding was one of my favorite things in this project.</p>
          <p>I made a mind-map, created a moodboard and decided on a color palette. Then I started sketching a few logos.</p>
          <p>The emotions and characteristics that I wanted to convey through the brand were happiness, balance, joy, energy, vitality and freshness.</p>
        <h6>Deciding on a Name</h6>
          <p>Some of the options were:</p>
          <ul class="br-names">
            <li class="br-name">Lean & Clean</li>
            <li class="br-name">Muscle & Curve</li>
            <li class="br-name">Fit/Me</li>
            <li class="br-name">Re/Fresh</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The concept behind the brand was to combine the two aspects of healthy living: eating right and exercising, and the balance to achieve optimal health. These two elements differ in feeling and expression, but lead to the same end goal - being healthy. My challenge was to combine these different elements in a way that will convey both a calming and energetic feeling.</p>

                  I did a few preference tests to help me make some design decisions. I implemented the preferences of the users to my design.<br />

        <h4>FINAL THOUGHTS</h4>
        <p>Thank you for reading this far! </p>
        <p>I created a cloud storage app for health & fitness enthusiasts. I expanded the options of what the users can do on it and I believe I was successful at doing that.</p>
        <p>There are a few things that I would do differently or better if I had more time:<br />
        1. Improve the folders section and make the filing process easier<br />
        2. I would add more features</p>
        <h6>What I learned about myself</h6>
        <p>This was a very big project and I enjoyed working on it. I learned that I love to design and get lost in the process. The research and discovery phase was also very interesting and I learned that there are many opportunities in the cloud storage market, but you do have to work hard to create a product that would stand out.</p>
        <p>Things that I need to improve:<br />
          1. Being more organized, since it’s key to staying within the timeframe.<br />
          2. I thought I was good at paying attention to details. But this took it to the next level. That is crucial for producing a professional product.</p>
