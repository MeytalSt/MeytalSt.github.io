        <h2><b>INTRO</b></h2>
        <p>This is the story of how the mother of a dancer (me!) decided to find a solution to all the information she was getting from her daughter’s dance studio. The mother, who also happens to be a UX designer, came up with an idea that would simplify the way information is passed to parents and organize it so parents can save time and lower their stress level.</p>

          <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p class="problem-copy">Dance studios, sports teams, and other frameworks for kids’ activities communicate with parents in an archaic way, mostly via emails and printed letters. Parents struggle to keep track of all this information and sometimes forget important details about their children’s activities. Often, parents have more than one child in multiple activities and keeping track of all the information that comes from the various coaches, instructors, and teachers, becomes very challenging.</p>

          <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
          <p class="solution-copy">Macrame is an app that helps parents and administrators in various kids' activities, communicate better, organize the information, get reminders before important events and keep all the information in one place.</p>

        <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
          <p>In this project, I was tasked with creating a solution to a problem that I got to choose. I took a look at my life and the things that I would like to find solutions for. The most pressing issue at the time was finding a way to simplify the way parents communicate with their children’s coaches/instructors/teachers and finding a way to organize and keep all the info parents get into one place. I got excited about the idea. I talked to other parents and discovered that many of us struggle to keep track of all the info, which results in higher levels of stress around the times when our children have special events.</p>
          <p>My role in this project was to do the research, develop and design a solution to these problems. The timeline for this project was very short, so I created a plan with strict deadlines for each phase of the design process.</p>

                    <li class="survey-g"><p>2. What kind of info do parents need to remember and how do they arrange all that info currently?</p></li>

Was it a reflection of the mothers’ involvement in their children’s activities versus the fathers?</p>

        <p>There is an opportunity to market my product to parents with children in extracurricular activities. None of the apps I researched target this market. They are not aimed at improving the communication between coaches/instructors and parents and organize information.</p>
        <p>This product is unique in that it’s meant to work with the user’s existing calendar on their phone. The apps I researched have their own calendars and they import the info from the users’ phones. This app sends the info to the user’s calendar.</p>

          <h4>PERSONAS</h4>
          <p>Based on the survey results, I created personas, user stories, and user flows.</p>
          <p>The three personas I created are all women with children in extracurricular activities. They are based on people who answered followup questions after the survey. They reflect the important things that the users want in the app:</p>
          <ul class="userstories">
            <li class="user-story">Save time by having all the info in one place</li>
            <li class="user-story">Get alerts when there are changes in the schedule</li>
            <li class="user-story">See everything in one calendar</li>
            <li class="user-story">Knowing the times and special events</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Simply put, their needs are to have less stress regarding their kids’ activities.</p>

        <h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
          <h4>SITE MAP & CONTENT STRATEGY</h4>
            <p>I created a sitemap to establish the scope of the project. I was doing my best to keep the project small and limit the number of features for the MVP. As I was creating the site map, I looked back at the user flows to make sure that I’m following the structure I established. Later, I referred back to the site map as I was designing the wireframes. This was very helpful in keeping the wireframes organized.</p>
        <div class="sitemap">
          <h5>Site Map</h5>
          <!-- mobile image -->
          <img class="sitemap-mobile" src="images/macrame_site_map_crop.png" alt="site map"/>
          <!-- laptop image -->
          <img class="sitemap-laptop" src="images/macrame_site_map.png" alt="site map"/>
        </div>
        <p>Some of the challenges I encountered while creating the sitemap, were having to decide on which page to put the different features of the app and how they would look (icon, words, hamburger menu). Furthermore, while creating the wireframe sketches, I was trying to think of the best way for the page layout. To solve this challenge, I looked at the competitors' designs and on Dribbble, I got inspired and came up with designs that I believed would work well.</p>
        <p>At this point, I also wrote the content strategy.</p>
        <h4>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h4>
          <p>I started hand-sketching a few wireframes for the landing page and  the dashboard.</p>
        <div class="sitemap">
          <h5>Dashboard Sketches</h5>
          <!-- mobile image -->
          <img class="sitemap-mobile" src="images/Dashboard_sketches.png" alt="site map"/>
          <!-- laptop image -->
          <img class="sitemap-laptop" src="images/Dashboard_sketches.png" alt="site map"/>
        </div>
        <p>Some of the questions that came up during this phase were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="survey-g"><p>1. How can I write the content before I decide which design to go with?</p></li>
          <li class="survey-g"><p>2. What’s the best way to word things so the user understands what this product is and why they should use it?</p></li>
          <li class="survey-g"><p>3. Is it enough to give the users the option of creating groups? </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Originally, I thought it would be good to have two separate features: create a group and add family members to the account. At that point, I hadn’t made a decision and decided to test it with users first.</p>
        <p>Next, I started designing all the wireframes in Figma. As I was working through this phase, I kept asking myself, how can I make this better and more efficient? How can I save steps for the users?</p>
        <p>The most challenging part was getting started. I needed to get some inspiration. I went to Dribbble and looked at a lot of ideas, found the ones that I liked and implemented them into my designs. I was very drawn to card-style designs with rounded edges.</p>
        <div class="sitemap">

          <h4>WIREFRAMES</h4>
            <p>I started sketching the wireframes by hand, using the Crazy Eights technique for the landing page.</p>
            <p>I hand sketched all the wireframes and then went on to design them on Figma. I designed the wireframes for a desktop. As I was designing the wireframes, I referred back to the user stories, user flows, personas and content strategy to make sure that everything is included.</p>

          <h4 id="prototype">CLICKABLE PROTOTYPE I</h4>
            <p>More details in the processes of each user flow came up that I didn’t think about in the wireframing stage. I spent a considerable amount of time creating the prototype, using Figma. I added screens that were essential for the proper function of the website, and referred back to the user flows to make sure every step was represented. I had to alter some of the user flows when I saw that some of the things I included there didn’t make sense. </p>
          <div>
            <h6>Sign-up page</h6>
              <p>There was too much space between elements. I reduced the spacing and  changed the layout of fields and buttons to being side by side.</p>

          <p>After testing the prototype, I felt that my project got out of scope. I decided to remove some of the user stories/flows from the project that were not necessary for the MVP.

        <h4>BRANDING</h4>
          <p>Branding was one of my favorite things in this project.</p>
          <p>I made a mind-map, created a moodboard and decided on a color palette. Then I started sketching a few logos.</p>
          <p>The emotions and characteristics that I wanted to convey through the brand were happiness, balance, joy, energy, vitality and freshness.</p>
        <h6>Deciding on a Name</h6>
          <p>Some of the options were:</p>
          <ul class="br-names">
            <li class="br-name">Lean & Clean</li>
            <li class="br-name">Muscle & Curve</li>
            <li class="br-name">Fit/Me</li>
            <li class="br-name">Re/Fresh</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The concept behind the brand was to combine the two aspects of healthy living: eating right and exercising, and the balance to achieve optimal health. These two elements differ in feeling and expression, but lead to the same end goal - being healthy. My challenge was to combine these different elements in a way that will convey both a calming and energetic feeling.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Added one more screen in the account settings that tells the users that the process is finished, and added a link to the Dashboard.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I also asked the users about the branding of RE:fresh. I was pleased to hear that the emotions and image I was trying to convey were successful!</p>

          <h4>FINISHING TOUCHES</h4>
          <p>Following the user testing, I was ready to make the final changes and put the finishing touches to the project. I went through all the screens and made the improvements that were needed, as well as upgrading a few other visual design elements.</p>

      <section class="process" id="final">
        <h3>I WASN'T QUITE DONE YET</h3>
        <p>Well, I thought I was done, but after receiving feedback on my visual design I decided to upgrade my design even more.<br />
          Anywhere there was a potential color contrast and readability issues, I changed the colors to create better visual hierarchy.</p>
        <div>
          <h6>Improvements to Homepage</h6>
              <p>Nav bar was changed to being at the top of the image & logo changed to white.</p>
              <p>Border was removed from CTA buttons.</p>
              <div class="mockup4">
                <img src="images/hero_final.png" alt="Hero image"/>
              </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Combined 2 sections into one and added more visual interest and consistency in the stroke of the icons.</p>
            <div class="mockup4">
              <img src="images/section_homepage.png" alt="Homepage section"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Improvements to Dashboard</h6>
            <p>Made the dashboard more informationally dense, and more complex by adding more features.</p>
            <div class="mockup4">
              <img src="images/dashboard_final.png" alt="Dashboard final"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Added a “quick add” button, which opens another screen upon clicking.</p>
            <div class="mockup4">
              <img src="images/dashboard_overlay.png" alt="Dashboard overlay"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h6>Color Throughout</h6>
            <p>Having the light teal text caused some color contrast issues as well as having the grey text over light blue background.<br />
              I flipped the prioritization - making the nav bar dark green with white text to increase the contrast. Also changed the background color to a lighter blue, so the text would be more readable.</p>
            <div class="mockup4">
              <img src="images/content_page.png" alt="Content page"/>
            </div>
            <div class="mockup4">
              <img src="images/my_cloud_page.png" alt="My-cloud page"/>

        <h4>FINAL THOUGHTS</h4>
        <p>Thank you for reading this far! </p>
        <p>I created a cloud storage app for health & fitness enthusiasts. I expanded the options of what the users can do on it and I believe I was successful at doing that.</p>
        <p>There are a few things that I would do differently or better if I had more time:<br />
        1. Improve the folders section and make the filing process easier<br />
        2. I would add more features</p>
        <h6>What I learned about myself</h6>
        <p>This was a very big project and I enjoyed working on it. I learned that I love to design and get lost in the process. The research and discovery phase was also very interesting and I learned that there are many opportunities in the cloud storage market, but you do have to work hard to create a product that would stand out.</p>
        <p>Things that I need to improve:<br />
          1. Being more organized, since it’s key to staying within the timeframe.<br />
          2. I thought I was good at paying attention to details. But this took it to the next level. That is crucial for producing a professional product.</p>
